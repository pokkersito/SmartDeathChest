## About

**SmartDeathChest** is a UHC-style plugin for **PocketMine-MP 5** that creates a smart double chest at the location where a player dies. It securely stores all dropped items and armor in an organized layout, protected by a floating hologram displaying a live countdown.

When the timer runs out, the chest disappears with sound and visual effects, and any remaining items are dropped on the ground.

## How Does It Work?

When a player dies:
- A **double chest** is spawned at the death location.
- The playerâ€™s inventory and armor are automatically saved inside the chest.
- A **floating hologram** appears above the chest showing:
  - The player's name
  - A real-time countdown (in seconds)
- When the countdown ends:
  - The chest is removed
  - Any leftover items are dropped naturally
  - An **explosion sound and particle** effect is played
